# 🐍 Python for Everybody Assignments

This repository contains selected assignments from the **Python for Everybody Specialization** by Dr. Charles Severance (Dr. Chuck), offered via Coursera. These hands-on exercises gave me foundational experience with Python and introduced me to its practical applications in the real world.

## ✨ What I've Learned

Through these assignments, I explored core programming techniques and built projects that reflect how Python is used outside the classroom:

- 📂 **File handling & text parsing**
- 🔗 **Working with APIs** using `urllib` and `requests`
- 🌐 **Web scraping** with `BeautifulSoup`
- 📊 **Parsing and handling data** with `JSON`, CSV
- 🗄️ **Database creation and querying** using `SQLite`
- 🧪 **Debugging, logic flow**, and scripting for real-world tasks

## 📁 What's Inside

- `tracksss.py`: Reads CSV and populates a SQLite database with linked tables
- `tracks.csv`: Sample dataset used for SQL practice
- `tracknow.sqlite`: Output database generated by the script
- Other assignment files are being added as I complete the specialization

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Ensure `Python 3.x` is installed.
3. Run any script directly from the terminal:
   ```bash
   python filename.py

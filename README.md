# 🧠 Python & API Portfolio Repository

This repository features a collection of assignments and projects completed during the **Python for Everybody Specialization** by the **University of Michigan on Coursera**. It reflects my progress through various modules and topics—including JSON parsing, working with APIs, web scraping, SQL databases, and core Python programming.

Some assignments outside the listed directories are currently incomplete, as I’m actively organizing and refining this portfolio for clarity and professionalism.

## 📁 Structure Overview

This repo includes the following key directories:
- `GeoAPI`: API integrations using location and mapping services.
- `SQLBasics`: SQL queries, schema designs, and database operations.
- `JSONProcessing`: Handling, parsing, and formatting JSON data.
- `PythonAssignments`: Foundational Python programs covering loops, file handling, and debugging.

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Demonstrated

- **Python**: Core programming, file operations, error handling
- **JSON**: Data formatting, parsing, and real-world use cases
- **APIs**: Consuming and working with external APIs
- **SQL**: Writing queries, creating schemas, and handling databases
- **Web Parsing & Scraping**: Extracting structured and unstructured data from websites

## 🚀 Highlights

- 📚 Coursera-based learning from University of Michigan
- 🧪 Real-world data manipulation through APIs and databases
- 🔧 Debugging workflow with VS Code shortcuts and GitHub version control
- 🔄 Transitioning from SQLite to MySQL for scalable projects

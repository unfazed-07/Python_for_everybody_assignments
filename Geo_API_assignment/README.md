# 🌍 Geo API Location Finder

This project allows users to input any location name via the terminal and receive detailed geographical information including:
- Country
- State or Region
- Postal Code (Pincode)
- Latitude and Longitude

It leverages a geo-location API and demonstrates the practical use of **JSON parsing** and **urllib** in Python.

## 📦 Features

- 🔎 **Real-time Location Lookup**: Enter any location in plain text (e.g., “Tokyo”, “Shimla”) and receive structured location metadata.
- 🌐 **API Integration**: Sends requests to a geo-based web service and processes the returned JSON response.
- 🧮 **Data Extraction**: Parses nested JSON to retrieve meaningful geographic data.
- 📤 **Terminal Interaction**: Clean CLI prompts make the tool easy to use and test.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: Scripting and CLI functionality
- **urllib**: Accessing and reading data from the web
- **JSON**: Handling structured response data
- **Geo API**: Location search and metadata extraction

## 🎓 Learning Context

This assignment was developed as part of the **Python for Everybody Specialization** by the **University of Michigan on Coursera**. It reflects hands-on experience with API consumption, data parsing, and transforming raw response data into readable formats.

# 📦 JSON-Based Assignments

This directory includes two hands-on Python scripts demonstrating my understanding of JSON data handling, parsing, and integration with external sources. These assignments were completed as part of the **Python for Everybody Specialization** by the **University of Michigan on Coursera**.
